# Project 2
This project is going to focus on iteration, arrays, 2D arrays, and
dictionaries. You can choose whether or not to use `for` or `while` loops for
each of the tasks.

Run `python3 test.py` to test your code.

Run `python3 -v test.py` to see the results of each individual test.

To reduce visual clutter while working, I highly recommend commenting out the tests that you're not working on. (By commenting out the function definition and its contents).

Feel free to add onto test.py if you want to do more thorough testing.

Part 1: Iteration
-----------------
`def next_perfect_squares(start)`
* **Description**: Given some start number, return the next 5 perfect squares
as a string separated by spaces.
* **Examples**:
```
next_perfect_squares(0) => '1 4 9 16 25'
next_perfect_squares(50) => '64 81 100 121 144'
```

`def fizzbuzz(num)`
* **Description**: Given some number, create a string from 1 to num, where each value is separated by commas. If the number is a multiple of 3, put **Fizz**
instead. If the number is a multiple of 5, put **Buzz** instead. If the number
is a multiple of both, put **FizzBuzz**.
* **Examples**:
```
fizzbuzz(15) => '1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8,
                Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz'
```
